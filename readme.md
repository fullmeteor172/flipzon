The goal of this project is to give me the opportunity to practice and apply my skills in web development, including front-end design, back-end development, and database management.

The Amazon clone website will have many of the same features as the real Amazon website
- A home page that displays a selection of popular products
- A search bar that allows users to search for specific products
- Product pages that display detailed information about each product, including images, prices, and customer reviews
- A shopping cart that allows users to add and remove items, and displays the total cost of their purchases
- A checkout page that allows users to enter their payment and shipping information, and place their order
- An account page that allows users to view and edit their personal information, and view their order history
